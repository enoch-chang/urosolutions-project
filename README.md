# UroSolutions Project

This is the design repository for UroSolutions. Although the team collaborates on the documentation over Google Docs due to its real-time capabilities, all completed documentation is also uploaded onto the GitHub. 

The GitHub repository is organized into two main folders: Documentation and Prototyping. The Documentation contains files such as functional decomposition, the Design Foundation Document, background research and relevant Pugh matrices used to support design decisions. The Prototyping folder contains all material related to engineering aspects, from sketches, materials, CAD models, code and testing data for various iterations. Our Prototyping also includes relevant materials used in designing the testing models used to test our prototypes.
